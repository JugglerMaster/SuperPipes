# SuperPipes
Currently this is my latest attempt at building a minecraft mod. As this is my first mod I would love feedback on my coding.

If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behaviour feel free to do so.

Creating goals and initializing project

# Goals of  this project:

Create new fancy pipes with a modular system that allows for customization.

I want user created pipe logic where the pipe doesn't decide what to route and where to route it but the end user does. Simple routing logic would include sending item to calculated route when item enters the pipe. 

Create super fast and efficient pipes.

Create pipes that use power for the fastest version. 

Multiple tier system of pipes for early/late game use. 

Early game primitive pipes that force the user to right click with a wrench to turn routes on and off but very cheap.

Mid game pipes with a gui to change interaction between nodes
Late game auto placing pipes that allow the user to right click where they want the pipe to go (line path) or hold right click to constantly create the path as they move. Done with a wand and pipes in inventory of player or a block. These pipes could also be invisible and the player can walk through them.

Multiblock pipe system for crafting high tier items.
