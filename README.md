# SuperPipes
Currently this is my latest attempt at building a minecraft mod. As this is my first mod I would love feedback on my coding. 

If you wish to submit a pull request to fix bugs or broken behaviour feel free to do so. 

Current Status: Creating goals and initializing project

Goals of  this project:
Create new fancy pipes with a modular system that allows for customization.
I want user created pipe logic where the pipe doesn't decide what to route and where to route it but the end user does.
